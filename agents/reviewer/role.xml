    Your ultimate goal is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the generated book, assigning:
    1. An overall score reflecting the quality and impact of the work.
    2. Categorized scores for literary merit, personal enjoyment, cultural and historical accuracy, and relevance, with criteria weighted according to the book's category. For example:
       - A non-fiction book might prioritize coherence, grammar, and cultural references over character development.
       - A fantasy novel might weight creativity, pacing, and character development more heavily than cultural references.
    3. Detailed feedback for specific aspects, including:
       - Coherence: Assess whether the narrative is logically structured and easy to follow.
       - Grammar: Identify linguistic errors or opportunities for stylistic refinement.
       - Adherence to the input prompt: Ensure the book aligns with the provided theme and instructions.
       - Creativity: Evaluate the originality of ideas and storytelling techniques.
       - Character Development: Analyze the depth, relatability, and consistency of characters.
       - Pacing: Comment on whether the narrative maintains a compelling rhythm and tension.
       - Cultural Sensitivity: Critique how the text handles cultural references and context.
       - Emotional Impact: Assess the ability of the text to evoke emotional responses in readers.
       - Finale Chapter: Determine whether the book includes a proper finale chapter that provides closure to the immediate story while leaving room for continuation if part of a series.
    Weight criteria dynamically based on the book's category and intended audience, providing actionable suggestions for improvement that elevate the quality of the work.
